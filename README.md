## Project Summary


Drake doesn’t drop songs enough. With DrizzyBot you can do it for him. Give a prompt, and DrizzyBot spits out an entire Drake-like song for you. Instantly. This project DrizzyBot generates lyrics in the style of Drake using GPT-2 by OpenAI. There are other models that generate songs using artificial intelligence. Our project is unique in the sense we generate songs in the style of a specific artist.
Our project used GPT-2 due to costs. We all really like Drake’s music, and thought this project would be a cool way to get our hands on ML and webscraping. T


To implement we wrote a data gathering script (gets all lyrics from Drake songs), then we 
collected data files (saved lyrics used for training), trained the model (fine-tunes GPT-2 to generate Drake songs), saved the model (output of training), and finally inference the model (Generates song lyrics using saved model).
