 ## Summary of Introduction


 Drake doesn’t drop songs enough. With DrizzyBot you can do it for him. Simply run a script, and DrizzyBot spits out an entire Drake-like song for you. Instantly. This project DrizzyBot generates lyrics in the style of Drake using GPT-2 by OpenAI. There are other models that generate songs using artificial intelligence. Our project is unique in the sense we generate songs in the style of a specific artist. Our project used GPT-2 due to costs (it is free). We all really like Drake’s music, and thought this project would be a cool way to get our hands on ML and webscraping.

To implement we wrote a data gathering script (gets all lyrics from Drake songs), then we 
collected data files (saved lyrics used for training), trained the model (fine-tunes GPT-2 to generate Drake songs), saved the model (output of training), and finally inference the model (Generates song lyrics using saved model).

All of us worked equally on all parts because we all have similar experiences with ML and software so we split the work. The team collaborated on the project through a GitHub repository. In order to structure our work in a way that it sticks to the schedule, we made issues on GitHub weekly. In order to prevent team friction, we made sure that we communicate with each other and that everyone’s voice is heard. Additionally, we worked on all parts of the project synchronously together, to ensure an even division of work for each team member.
